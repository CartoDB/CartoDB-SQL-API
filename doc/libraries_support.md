# Libraries in Different Languages

To make things easier for developers, we provide client libraries for different programming languages and caching functionalities.

- **R**  
  To help more researchers use CARTO to drive their geospatial data, we have released the R client library. [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/Vizzuality/cartodb-r)

- **NODE.js**  
  This demo app authenticates with your CARTO and shows how to perform read and write queries using the SQL API. [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/Vizzuality/cartodb-nodejs)

- **PHP**  
  The PHP library provides a wrapper around the SQL API to get PHP objects straight from SQL calls to CARTO. [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/Vizzuality/cartodbclient-php)

- **PYTHON**  
  Provides API Key access to SQL API. [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/vizzuality/cartodb-python)

- **JAVA**  
  Very basic example of how to access CARTO SQL API. [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/cartodb/cartodb-java-client)

- **NET**  
  .NET library for authenticating with CARTO using an API Key, based on work started by [The Data Republic](http://www.thedatarepublic.com/). [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/thedatarepublic/CartoDBClientDotNET)

- **Clojure**  
  Clojure library for authenticating with CARTO, maintained by [REDD Metrics](http://www.reddmetrics.com/). [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/reddmetrics/cartodb-clj)

- **iOS**  
  Objective-C library for interacting with CARTO in native iOS applications. [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/jmnavarro/cartodb-objectivec-client)
